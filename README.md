A random walk was used for the drones path instead of random selection. A World Class was used to pull wind acceleration values. A Drone class was created to keep track of the Drone's path. A Filter Class was used for the prediction and paramter update functions in the Kalman Filter. Questions 1-3 are implemented in various functions that are run in a main function. The confidence ellipse plotting function is from MatPlotLibs Documentation.
